This repository contains the relevant files to build .deb
files for the facebook fork of the tac_plus server. Build
files are included for both Debian 7 (Wheezy) and Debian 8
(Jessie).

Right now, only amd64 binaries are generated.

To build:
	- mv src fb-tac-plus_4.0.4.19.1
	- cp -R debian-{selected-version} tacacs+-FB4.0.4.19.1/debian
	- cd fb-tac-plus_4.0.4.19.1
	- dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -b
To install:
	- cd ..
	- dpkg -i fb-tac-plus_4.0.4.19.1-1_amd64.deb

The package name is fb-tac-plus, config is stored in /etc/tac_plus.conf
(where a default config that YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY CHANGE exists). The
initscripts are /etc/init.d/fb-tac-plus.

Enjoy, and thanks to the facebook guys for the changes that they made
here :-)
